# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction using Mammogram Data

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a breast cancer case is benign or malignant based on mammogram image features.

## 📌 Project Overview

Early detection of breast cancer can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project uses supervised learning algorithms to classify tumors using features extracted from digitized mammogram data.

## 🔍 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic))
- **Features**: 30 numeric features related to cell nuclei in digitized images
- **Target**: Malignant or Benign classification

## ⚙️ Models Used

# 🫁 Lung Cancer Prediction using Symptoms and Patient Data

This machine learning project predicts whether a patient has lung cancer based on medical attributes and symptoms.

## 📌 Project Overview

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. This predictive system aims to assist early detection using patient data and reported symptoms through various ML classifiers.

## 🔍 Dataset

- **Source**: Public health dataset with 15+ features
- **Features include**: Age, Gender, Smoking status, Coughing, Shortness of breath, Wheezing, etc.
- **Target**: Binary classification — Lung cancer presence (`Yes`/`No`)

## ⚙️ Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
